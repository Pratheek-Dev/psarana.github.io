Hello!

My name is Parveen Kaur and I am currently a Masters Student at The University of British Columbia, UBC, in the Masters of Data Science Program. I completed my undergraduate degree also at UBC as a Major in Biology.

You can usually find me nursing a 3 hour old coffee pretending to do assignments while actually browsing Pinterest.
